# Supabase migration scripts

These SQL files are a **copy** of the official migrations located at:

- `supabase/migrations/`

They are duplicated here because the request asked for all Supabase scripts inside a `migration` folder.

Run migrations using the Supabase CLI (recommended) from `supabase/migrations/`.
